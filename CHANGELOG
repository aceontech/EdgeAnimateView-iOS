EdgeAnimateView provides one-liner support for displaying Adobe Edge Animate
compositions on iOS devices. Depending on the target OS (iOS 7, 8 or 9),
EdgeAnimateView will pick the right web view and configure it for you. On iOS
versions 8 and up, WKWebView is used, which provides native Safari web
performance for your animations.
